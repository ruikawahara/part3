# Full Stack Open 2020 - Part 3

## Overview
This repository is a dedicated repository for part 3 of Full Stack Open course, offered by University of Helsinki.

Since Part 3 of this course uses Heroku to deploy back-end application to the internet, it was recommended to have its own repository instead of pushing to master repository.

This repo will be copied to my master repo, which will have all the completed assignments, upon completion of part 3.

Current master repository can be referenced [here](https://github.com/ruikawahara/Fullstack_Open_2020).

## Index:
1. Part A - Node.js, and Express (ex 3.1 - 3.8)
2. Part B - Deploying App to Internet (ex 3.9 - 3.11)
3. Part C - Saving Data to MongoDB (ex 3.12 - 3.18)
4. Part D - Validation and ESLint (ex 3.19 - 3.22)
