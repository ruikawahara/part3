## Overview
This repository is a dedicated repository for part 3 of Full Stack Open course, offered by University of Helsinki.

Since Part 3 of this course uses Heroku to deploy back-end application to the internet, it was recommended to have its own repository instead of pushing to master repository.

This repo will be copied to my master repo, which will have all the completed assignments, upon completion of part 3.

Current master repository can be referenced [here](https://github.com/ruikawahara/Fullstack_Open_2020).

## Index:
1. Section A - Node.js, and Express (ex 3.1 - 3.8)
2. Section B - Deploying App to Internet (ex 3.9 - 3.11)
3. Section C - Saving Data to MongoDB (ex 3.12 - 3.18)
4. Section D - Validation and ESLint (ex 3.19 - 3.22)

## Misc. Notes:
* Completed part A before creating this new repo. If you wish to see the progress, please check commit history on master repository.

* For front-end, I used __Phonebook__ exercise, which is my personal solution, from part 2 of this course. 

* For ESLint excersie, indentation restriction is not as strict as examples given. This is because my VS Code has __Prettier__ code formatting extension, which automatically adjusts its own indentation for better readability. 

* For ESLint exercise, ```.eslintrc.js``` setting is based mostly on examples provided on Part 3D. However, default setting is not modified if it was not touched on exercise (e.g. version number). Furthermore, setting for "unix" is changed to "windows" since my development environment is Windows
